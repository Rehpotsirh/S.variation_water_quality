## Summary
In Nigeria, ground water is the most utilized freshwater source as it is a readily available source of potable water, it is more convenient and less vulnerable to pollution than surface water. The focus of this study was to investigate groundwater quality around Ugbowo and its environs for domestic utilization. 

## Scope and Methods
Ten (10) randomly selected boreholes were used for the study. Water samples were collected and stored in clean dried plastic bottles and labelled appropriately. The coordinates of the boreholes from which water samples were collected was determined with the aid of Garmin hand-held GPS receiver while the in-situ parameters, namely; pH, temperature, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids and dissolved oxygen were determined few hours after sample collection, since their concentration changes with time. Laboratory analysis of the groundwater samples was done with the aid of standard experimental procedures and equipment, while analysis of the data was done using selected statistical techniques such as water quality index and multivariate analysis of variance.

## Results and Recommendation
From the results obtained, it was observed that the pH of the samples were acidic in both seasons by WHO standards and elements such as Manganese (Mn), Phosphorus (P), Ammonium (NH4), Nitrite (NO2), Nitrate (NO3), Sulphate (SO4) were at ranges which exceeded WHO standards.
The computed water quality index showed variance between the dry **(99.89%)** and wet season **(99.88%)**, with the dry season having very slightly better quality compared to the wet season. **In conclusion, the statistical analysis showed that a high degree of seasonal variability exists due to season. Hence, the calculated Partial Eta Square of the Pillaiâ€™s Trace statistics revealed that more than 35% variability exists among the dependent variables (water quality parameters) occasioned by change in the time of sampling (season).**
